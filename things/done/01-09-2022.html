          Making Pride @ Kristin School
        </h2>
        <p id="subTitle" class="font-serif text-gray-600 mt-2 italic">
          We, the Pride Team, set out to create a positve LGBT movement at
          Kristin. While efforts to create safe spaces for LGBT students
          continued in the background, we wanted to create some noise in the
          wider community to expose LGBT issues at Kristin.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5"> It a 6th period physics class, near the end of 2020, and after the IB had just finished dragging us through the mud to the end of Year 1. I was sitiing next to my two fav besties. There had been some discussion over the past couple of days about the state of LGBT affairs at Kristin. At the time, the school lacked good LGBT policy and our safe spaces were under threat (more on that later). </p>

        <p class="mt-5">Over the summer, we put our ideas down on paper. We created a Pride vision for Kristin, we laid out our reasoning, and devised a brief action plan. We took this plan to an iconic teacher, and out school's principal. The teacher supported us and gave us connections, and the principle feedback and approval. After months of planning, and back and forth with various school staff, we launched Kristin
          Pride.

        <br>
        <p>
          What we accomplished: <br> <br>
          <ul class="list-disc">
              <li>We held a senior school assembly where a recent alum talked to students and teachers about
                the need for safe LGBTQ+ spaces at Kristin. 
              </li>
              <li>We held a movie night for the LGBTQ+ community and allies, to engage them with our work.</li>
              <li>We ran a teacher workshop with a presentation and Q&A, which lead to productive discussion around athletics, younger
                LGBT kids, and dealing with parents. We also built support for safe LGBT spaces.
              </li>
              <li>
                We fundraised at the Summer Carnival and Service Market, selling positve merchandise like pronoun
                pins.
              </li>
              <li>We ran another assembly, but focussed on HIV/AIDS. We launched our Red Ribbon campaign
                to fundraise for UNAIDS. We sold over 100 ribbons and raised over NZ$400.
              </li>
              <li>During lockdown 2021, we compiled a 10-page teacher handbook about the Kristin LGBTQ+ community. It included answers to questions they submitted. As well as personal student experiences, and a collection of resources. 
                This helped convey the hopes and aspirations of LGBTQ+ students.
              </li>
              <li>We passed on the role in the Kristin Pride group to a new set of students. We've also created a wave of external support for LGBTQ-safe policies that is helping to turn the tide against
                the residual homophobia/transphobia in the corners of our community.
              </li>
